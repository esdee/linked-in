All Hackday participants present their projects to the company and the best ones are awarded prizes and get turned into real products.

Worked with two German content providers to create a new back-end service to fetch (via XML over HTTP) and cache (in memcached) vacation package data. Integrated this data into new SEO friendly pages that allow users to find, compare and book package holidays.

                                        * Designed and developed the management software for a video contact center video content management server. The server included media monitoring (multi-threaded Java), multi-lingual metadata management (Java, XML, JAXB), searching & filtering (Apache Lucene), and video streaming (Darwin Streaming Server). Built two web front ends using JSP, JSTL, Struts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: one for administrators that behaved as a file manager and one for contact center a gents that behaved similar to YouTube. Both interfaces supported display and search in 16 languages and had to pass government accessibility requirements. Received a CVP Team Achievement Award for this project.

                                        * Individually developed an internal project codenamed "CFT" using Java and XML that served as a generic tool to help analyze and visualize log data for virtually any software product. Filed a patent for the CFT's generic approach to log parsing and analysis. Presented the CFT to Cisco's Voice Technology Group (VTG) at a "tech talk" and received praise from multiple Cisco VPs, directors, and managers, as well as two Cisco Achievement Program (CAP) Awards for my work. The CFT is now being used across VTG and has helped reduce support costs for multiple business units within Cisco.

To produce suitable load, the FRT was developed as a multi-threaded application that could be distributed over multiple computers. Implemented a prototype of the FRT using Java, XML and SQL and presented it to the Autex Group.

Worked with two German content providers to create a new back-end service to fetch (via XML over HTTP) and cache (in memcached) vacation package data. Integrated this data into new SEO friendly pages that allow users to find, compare and book package holidays.

                                        I was part of Cisco's [Customer Voice Portal](http://developer.cisco.com/web/cvp/) team, which develops VoIP contact center software for major clients such as the IRS, American Express, and Home Depot.

                                        * Designed and developed the management software for a video contact center video content management server. The server included media monitoring (multi-threaded Java), multi-lingual metadata management (Java, XML, JAXB), searching &amp; filtering (Apache Lucene), and video streaming (Darwin Streaming Server). Built two web front ends using JSP, JSTL, Struts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: one for administrators that behaved as a file manager and one for contact center a gents that behaved similar to YouTube. Both interfaces supported display and search in 16 languages and had to pass government accessibility requirements. Received a CVP Team Achievement Award for this project.

Filed a patent for the CFT's generic approach to log parsing and analysis. Presented the CFT to Cisco's Voice Technology Group (VTG) at a &quot;tech talk&quot; and received praise from multiple Cisco VPs, directors, and managers, as well as two Cisco Achievement Program (CAP) Awards for my work. The CFT is now being used across VTG and has helped reduce support costs for multiple business units within Cisco.

To produce suitable load, the FRT was developed as a multi-threaded application that could be distributed over multiple computers.
