Built two web front ends using JSP, JSTL, Struts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: one for administrators that behaved as a file manager and one for contact center a gents that behaved similar to YouTube. Both interfaces supported display and search in 16 languages and had to pass government accessibility requirements. Received a CVP Team Achievement Award for this project.\n\n* Individually developed an internal project codenamed \"CFT\" using Java and XML that served as a generic tool to help analyze and visualize log data for virtually any software product. Filed a patent for the CFT's generic approach to log parsing and analysis. Presented the CFT to Cisco's Voice Technology Group (VTG) at a \"tech talk\" and received praise from multiple Cisco VPs, directors, and managers, as well as two Cisco Achievement Program (CAP) Awards for my work. The CFT is now being used across VTG and has helped reduce support costs for multiple business units within Cisco.",
